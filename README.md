Information about diffusion2d.py: 
This code solves the diffusion equation in 2D over a square domain which is at 
a certain temperature and a circular disc at the center which is at a higher 
temperature. This code solves the diffusion equation using the 
Finite Difference Method. The thermal diffusivity and initial conditions of the
system can be changed by the user. The code produces four plots at various 
timepoints of the simulation. The diffusion process can be clearly observed in 
these plots.
