# Diffusion2D-Python-Package

## Instructions for students

Please follow the instructions in [pypi_exercise.md](https://github.com/Simulation-Software-Engineering/Lecture-Material/blob/main/03_building_and_packaging/pypi_exercise.md).

The code used in this exercise is based on [Chapter 7 of the book "Learning Scientific Programming with Python"](https://scipython.com/book/chapter-7-matplotlib/examples/the-two-dimensional-diffusion-equation/).

## Project description

This code solves the two-dimensional diffusion equation on the domain of the unit square applied to a metal plate. This plate is of a given temperature apart from a disc of a prespecified size which is at a different temperature. The method used is the Finite Difference Method. 
The thermal diffusivity of the steel as well as the intervals in x- and y-directions are given by user input, though there are initial standard values given. The code produces four plots at different timepoints of the simulation showing the diffusion process.
